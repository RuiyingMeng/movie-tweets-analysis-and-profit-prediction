# movie-tweets-analysis-and-profit-prediction
This project is mainly divided it into 3 parts:

1. Scrap tweets about the movie Justice League and the users' information. Clean the texts of tweets and do topic analysis with PCA.
2. Based users' information we get from part 1, we clean the data and use KMeans to classify users.
3. We find a dataset about movies' information on Kaggle. The data is from The Movie Database. We clean the data in this dataset and build machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, GradientBoostClassifier) to predict if a movie's revenue can be larger than its budget. That is, if the movie can make profit.
